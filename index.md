## CS 4641 Final Project Team 35: Mushroom Classification

# Background and Problem Definition

Mushrooms are a staple food in many parts of the world. However, we have always been cautioned to never eat wild mushrooms since many mushrooms can be poisonous and induce serious symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, breathing difficulties, kidney/liver failure, coma, or death. In fact, according to The National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 1999 to 2016, 133700 cases, or roughly 7428 cases per year, of mushroom exposure have been reported [1]. This staggering statistic coupled with a recent trend of mushroom hunting (or “shrooming”) makes it even more imperative that we can accurately identify which mushrooms are edible and which ones are inedible.

A way we can classify if a mushroom is edible or not is by looking at the physical features of the mushroom itself. However, with such a wide variety of mushrooms available, the classification is not as simple as looking at a single feature to determine how edible the mushroom is. Instead, we would have to consider many if not all of the features of the mushroom to make a definite conclusion.

Therefore, for this project, our objective is to create a machine learning model that can predict how edible a mushroom is based on the physical features of the mushrooms as accurately as possible. This will not only be a useful and convenient tool for mushroom hunters, but can also prevent people from mistakenly ingesting a potentially toxic mushroom.
